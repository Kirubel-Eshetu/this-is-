# this-is-bootstrap
- Here I am trying to see the structure of BootStrap after structuring it to vanilla CSS. Since bootstrap was minified.
- This is the work of Bootstrap team, I am just trying to learn how Bootstrap is written by converting the source code into a regular css code. 
   (Since BootStrap is made up with a bunch of CSS code).
